First class project designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap



// This is a basic web app designed during one of Dr. Angela Yu's Bootcamp lessons
// where we design a "dating" app for dogs- a concept mirrored from the 
// popular Tinder app.

// how to create responsive apps that are functional across different devices (i.e. PC to
// mobile.
